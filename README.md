these scripts are purly for setting up ubuntu server 22.04 
if you have a static ip change it to 192.168.8.110/192.168.8.187
you should be able to change in your router wifi or dhcp settings whether the is a .1 or .8 for example with the router admin page it cloud be 192.189.1.1 change it to 192.168.8.1 than change the server ips to as shown before 192.168.8.187/110 so these scripts will work

the script called everythingserverserup.sh is corrosponding to the ip 192.168.8.187 and everythingserver-2-setup.sh s 192.168.8.110
